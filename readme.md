# Railway Public Address System

## Overview
    The Railway Public Address System is a Python-based project that generates text and voice announcements for train schedules, delays, and passenger feedback. It processes train data, analyzes sentiment from feedback, and produces audio announcements using text-to-speech (TTS).

    This system provides clear, automated announcements for both delayed and on-time trains, offering a seamless experience for railway operations.

---

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Combines train schedules, delay logs, and passenger feedback into a unified dataset.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer to evaluate passenger feedback.
- **Announcements:** Generates text and voice announcements for trains.
- **Audio Playback:** Creates and plays `.mp3` files on macOS using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python:** Version 3.11 recommended.
- **Operating System:** Tested on macOS (compatible with Linux/Windows with minor adjustments).
- **Dependencies:** Listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Railwaymlproject
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install SpaCy Model and NLTK Data
```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"
```

### 5. Prepare Data Files
Place the following files in the `data/raw/` directory:
- `train_schedule.csv`: Contains train numbers, times, platforms, and destinations.
- `delay_logs.json`: Records train delays and reasons.
- `passenger_feedback.txt`: Includes passenger feedback.

---

## Usage

### 1. Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Run the System
```bash
    python main.py
```

### 3. Interact with the System
- Enter a train number (e.g., 108, 109) to generate an announcement.
- Type `exit` to quit.

**Example Output:**
```
    Announcement for Train 108: Train 108 to New York is delayed by 45 minutes due to weather. We apologize for the inconvenience.
```

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment
After running the system, deactivate the virtual environment using:
```bash
    deactivate
```
This will return you to your normal terminal session.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **ModuleNotFoundError**
- Ensure the virtual environment is activated using `source venv/bin/activate`.
- Confirm dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 2. **FileNotFoundError**
- Verify data files are present in the `data/raw/` directory.

### 3. **OSError (Spacy)**
- Ensure the SpaCy model is installed using:
  ```bash
     python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
  ```
